# Strategy to Achieve 85%+ Accuracy for XGBoost and LSTM Models

## Current Status
- **XGBoost**: ~71.75% average accuracy
- **LSTM**: ~74.50% average accuracy
- **Target**: 85%+ for both models

## 🎯 Key Strategies to Boost Accuracy

### 1. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**

#### Current Features (27 features):
- Basic lags: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30 days
- Rolling statistics: mean, std for 7, 14, 30 days
- Seasonal features: month, day of year
- Trend features: momentum, volatility

#### New Ultra-Advanced Features (100+ features):
```python
# Extended lag features
lags = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60]  # 11 features

# Advanced rolling statistics
windows = [7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60]  # 6 windows × 8 stats = 48 features
- mean, std, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, max, min, range

# Momentum and volatility features
- 4 momentum features (7, 14, 21, 30 days)
- 4 volatility features

# Advanced trend features
- Linear regression slopes for different windows

# Enhanced seasonal features
- Multiple seasonal cycles (monthly, weekly, daily)
- 8 seasonal features

# Price change ratios
- 8 change ratio features

# Moving average crossovers
- 4 MA crossover features

# RSI-like features
- 3 RSI features for different periods
```

### 2. **XGBoost Optimization Strategy**

#### Hyperparameter Tuning:
```python
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [500, 1000, 1500],
    'max_depth': [6, 8, 10, 12],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    'subsample': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0],
    'colsample_bytree': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0],
    'reg_alpha': [0, 0.1, 0.5],
    'reg_lambda': [0, 0.1, 0.5],
    'min_child_weight': [1, 3, 5],
    'gamma': [0, 0.1, 0.2]
}
```

#### Advanced Techniques:
- **TimeSeriesSplit**: Proper time series cross-validation
- **GridSearchCV**: Exhaustive hyperparameter search
- **Feature Selection**: Remove low-importance features
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple XGBoost models

### 3. **LSTM Optimization Strategy**

#### Advanced Architecture:
```python
model = Sequential([
    # Bidirectional LSTM layers
    Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    
    Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    
    Bidirectional(LSTM(32, return_sequences=False)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    
    # Dense layers
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])
```

#### Training Optimizations:
- **Advanced Optimizer**: Adam with custom learning rate
- **Regularization**: L1/L2 regularization
- **Callbacks**: EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint
- **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data generation
- **Ensemble**: Multiple LSTM models with different architectures

### 4. **Data Quality Improvements**

#### Data Preprocessing:
- **Outlier Detection**: Remove extreme price values
- **Missing Data**: Advanced imputation techniques
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data consistency
- **Feature Scaling**: MinMaxScaler for LSTM, StandardScaler for XGBoost

#### Additional Data Sources:
- **Weather Data**: Temperature, humidity, rainfall
- **Market Data**: Supply-demand indicators
- **Economic Data**: Inflation, currency rates
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Historical seasonal trends

### 5. **Ensemble Techniques**

#### Model Combination:
```python
# Weighted ensemble
final_prediction = (
    0.4 * xgb_prediction +
    0.4 * lstm_prediction +
    0.2 * additional_model_prediction
)
```

#### Advanced Ensembles:
- **Stacking**: Meta-learner to combine predictions
- **Blending**: Simple weighted average
- **Bagging**: Multiple models with different seeds
- **Boosting**: Sequential model training
