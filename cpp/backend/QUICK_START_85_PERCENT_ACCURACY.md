### Step 3: Monitor Progress
The script will:
1. Load data for each crop-mandi combination
2. Create ultra-advanced features (94 features)
3. Train XGBoost with extensive hyperparameter tuning
4. Train LSTM with advanced architecture
5. Calculate and display accuracy for each model
6. Save results to `ultra_accurate_model_results.csv`

## 📊 Expected Results

### Target Metrics:

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Memory Error**:
   - Reduce `n_estimators` in XGBoost parameters
   - Reduce batch size in LSTM training

2. **Training Time Too Long**:
   - Reduce parameter grid size
   - Use fewer cross-validation folds

3. **Accuracy Not Improving**:
   - Check data quality
   - Verify feature engineering
   - Try different hyperparameter ranges

## 🎯 Next Steps After Training

1. **Evaluate Results**: Check `ultra_accurate_model_results.csv`
2. **Update API**: Use new ultra-accurate models in your FastAPI backend
3. **Test Performance**: Run predictions with new models
4. **Monitor**: Track real-time accuracy
5. **Iterate**: Fine-tune based on results
