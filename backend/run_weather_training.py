"""
Weather-Enhanced Model Training Script
=====================================

This script trains models with weather features integrated for better prediction accuracy.

Usage:
    python run_weather_training.py

Features:
- Uses weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind, pressure)
- Creates weather-enhanced XGBoost and LSTM models
- Includes weather lags and rolling averages
- Provides fallback to regular models if weather data unavailable
